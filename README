Most Expensive Routine:
handle_instruction() (which is pretty much the entire program.)

See our lab notes for our analysis of handle_instruction() and the breakdown of
the number of instructions needed to handle the different UM instructions.

Our UM's performance is slightly better than the reference for midmark
and sandmark, and slightly worse for the provided partial adventure solution.

We think that there is no clear room for improvement for the arithmetic
operations of the UM, since the involved variables already live in registers.

We also think that the memory-related operations of the UM could
be sped up slightly if our memory system was better designed to make use of
registers. Specifically, if the pointer to our array of segment pointers lived
in a register (which our analysis indicated lived on the stack, since it was 
declared as a global variable), our program's performance may have improved.
If we made this pointer variable a local variable instead of a global variable,
the compiler may have been able to put it in a register to improve access.
